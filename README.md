# SQL

At the end of the course, I will learn SQL concepts like SQL Queries, SQL joints, SQL Injection, SQL Insert and creating tables in SQL.

To learn SQL no prior experience is required. Anyone can learn easily. 

## SQL -- > Structured queryLanguage

SQL is a standard database language used to access and manipulate data in the database.

IBM computer scientists develop SQL in the 1970s

based on executing SQL queries  we can Create, update, Delete, and retrieve Data in the database like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.

Finally, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.

### What is a Database?

Before going into what is database we should know that Data is unrecognised information, so to organise that data we make a Database.

if we split Database into two parts we get

Data - information of a particular person or a thing.
Base - base is like a backbone, i would explain you clearly with an example, when we construct a building we first make sure that basement is strong so that our building can be constructed in a proper and last longer from external vulnerabilities.

from the above context we came to some conclusion that to store any thigng or to stay any where we require shelter, to protect ourselfs and to be organised.

in the same way, to store data we are using a base which is a DBMS which we can call as Database Management System. this DBMS will controlled the structured data.

Database helps us to easily store, access, and manipulate data on a computer.
